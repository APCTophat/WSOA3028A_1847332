<pre>Blog #1

    Whilst looking at websites to get ideas for how I could design my website,
    I came across the website called SoInteractive <cite>https://sointeractive.co.za/</cite>.
    What struck me the most about this website was it's colour and shape identity.
    I looked at "The Meaning of Shapes: Developing visual Grammar"
    <cite>https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-grammar-shapes/</cite> to gain
    a better understanding of shape theory. I decided that I wanted a triangular theme 
    to run through my webpage. To enforce that my character is stable and reliable.
    This shape theme will be encorparated in buttons, tabs or image outlines.
