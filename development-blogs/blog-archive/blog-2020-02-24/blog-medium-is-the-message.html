        I have had a day to stew on M. McLuhan, <cite>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</cite>, New York: MIT Press, 1964, pp. 203-209 specifically, "The Medium is the message" and all I can say is that my head hurts. I understand what McLuhan was getting at, I think. From my understanding of the article is that the important question to ask is not "What is being made" but rather "The space in which it is being made in." <br>
        <br>
        So, it is not the context of the art piece but rather the entire medium that facilitates the art piece that conveys the artworks message. This medium is not only the physical medium but also the medium of the cultural, economic, technological and sociological space the piece was created in. And that this artwork conveys its message through or reflects those other mediums.<br>
        <br>
        Which makes sense to me, sort of, I understand the principal that society movies at the rate of its fastest technology and this rate of progression trickles down into every facet of a society. However, to say that the context of the 'thing', facilitated by the medium, is not the main message being portrayed just baffles me.<br>
        <br>
        Looking at the Internet as the current fastest technology and the medium it creates, I understand the importance of understanding the culture shifting potential this medium has achieved, is achieving and is yet to achieve. How what work is done in this medium is self-reflective on the medium itself. That to understand what message is being portrayed by the medium is to understand the medium and by extension understand the self which has extended itself through this medium. <br>
        <br>
        This reading is really fascinating and interesting but man I did not need a whole reshuffle of my understanding of life right now. <br>
        <br>
        Also, I do not believe McLuhan solved the question of the Chicken and the egg, as I believe his statement can go both ways as well. What if the egg is just the Chicken's idea for getting more Chickens HUH!
