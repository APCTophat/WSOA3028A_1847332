        My idea was to blatantly use stock photos so there was no doubt that it is a stock photo the viewer is looking at and not a photo ‘Dennis Scott’ had taken. So, all the photos should still have the water mark of the company that owns the photo and should have no clear consistency in the individuals that are in the photo. Rendering the photo, with no ‘proof’ that the events described really took place. 
<br><br>
         Since I decided to use stock photos as a replacement for standard photos this has left me in a creative problem. Either I have a post idea in mind and then look for a stock photo that fits what I am looking for, or I try and find an interesting stock photo and make a post around that.
<br><br>
         For example, this post:<a href="../../../dennis-scotts's-posts/post-archive/post-2020-04-02/post-2020-04-02.html"target="_blank">2020/04/02</a>. I had the idea that the lockdown was maybe getting to Dennis a little but either he is in denial or wants to pretend he is in denial. So obviously he is laughing because his cereal said something funny. This joke just needed a person looking at their breakfast cracking a smile. A couple minutes later and a refined search later I find a photo I am happy with and use it.
<br><br>
         However, for this example:<a href="../../../dennis-scotts's-posts/post-archive/post-2020-04-09/post-2020-04-09.html"target="_blank">2020/04/09</a>. I had found this gloriously surreal image and had to make a post out of it. I decided to go for a literal reading of the image of entering a city that has so clearly changed. Because frankly this whole Covid-19 pandemic has had far reaching ramifications that may only eventually manifest years down the line.

        Crap got a little too serious there…. Here have this:
