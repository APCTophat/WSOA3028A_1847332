        This week I was required to choose a tweet that encourages critical engagement with regards to technology, code, racism/discrimination in code and AI. For my blog I chose a Tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov" target="blank">@evgenymorozov</a>

    <p>
        I chose this tweet because I like the messages he is sending with this tweet. He is sending the message that technologies (phones, radio, code, ect) are created in and used in the manipulation of power. He also extends this by elaborating that the phrase “Technology is not neutral” contains confusion in its message, implying that there is a deeper implication when saying that something is not neutral. I will try and explore these themes and give my understanding, perspective, and thoughts on what is being said.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, I believe that it is important to understand where a message is coming from to provide context for its meaning. So, I investigated who Evgeny Morozov is and some prior work of his to understand more about him. He is an author, researcher and intellectual born in Belarus who eventually moved to the United States. His main school of thought is that of scepticism that the internet helps with the democratization of authoritarian regimes. Expanding that the internet could also help these authoritarian regimes with mass surveillance, political repression, and nationalist propaganda <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov" target="blank">(Evgeny Morozov)</a><!--I am under no illusion of the issues with using wikipedia as a source but I found it hard to get credible information about his life and I do not have the time to keep digging to find it--> He has written two books titled <i>The Net Delusion: the Dark Side of Internet Freedom</i> and <i>To Save Everything, Click Here.</i> He has also provided a TED talk in 2009 called<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/evgeny_morozov_how_the_net_aids_dictatorships/transcript?language=en " target="blank">How the Net aids dictatorships</a>
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        From what I could find out about him. He does not see this internet as this magical entity that if people had it, they would automatically gravitate towards a democratic system. He sees the internet as a possible tool to further oppressive rule instead of a tool to liberate it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In his tweet I think it is important to acknowledge that he specifically says “Technologies” and not just “Internet”, my understanding is that he is referring to all aspects of communicative technologies that function of power relation. I understand this as referring to Books, Radio, Tv, the internet and cell phones. Which means that the issue being addressed here is not a new issue but has been a systemic problem throughout history. I mean if you can control what people believe by whatever means, you hold a lot of power.
    </p>
    <p>
        I looked into the responses that this tweet evoked and isolated one that I believed furthered the argument and elaborated on Movozov’s point. This response come from an individual who goes by the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/CamiloGuezRodri" target="blank">@CamiloGuezRodri</a>:

        What I understand from Mr Rodriguez’s response is that to criticize the technology power relations requires it to be compared to a perceives ultimate purpose of the technology. So, for example: if books with redacted paragraphs purpose is to keep the current ruling power in power, that needs to be contrasted with the original purpose of a book itself. That being of information: storage and transfer. For this example, it can be argued that the “power” has manipulated this initial intent for self-gain leaving the book not as an accomplice to power but a victim of it. However, Dr Morozov responds with a quote: 
    </p>

    <p>
        Which argues that to engage critically of technology requires an understanding of technologies history, a history that is dictated and curated by a specific power. Meaning that any critical analysis of current technologies with be influenced by the powers the critique is against if a “neutral’ historical understanding of these technologies is not used. It continues to say that a critical breakdown of technology is ultimately futile while the systems that technology engages with contains gaps that needs to be critically engaged with and developed beforehand. Suggesting that technology should be an afterthought during this critical process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leading this back to the book example. Morozov is saying that before we even consider the role that the book played in keeping the power in power. We first need to understand the power itself and how it could be using books to propagate its power.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I agree with aspects of what Dr Morozov is saying in his tweet. The phrase “Technology is not neutral” is vague enough to cause confusion, as it never explicitly states what that statement is implying. That technology is created, propagated, and supported by prevailing ideas and ideologies in a system. These ideas may be perceived as positive or they may not, it is depending on the system that is in control. I agree that technologies are created to server a function of the system that is creating it. The “space race” while it made great strides into space travel, had the underlying “Missile measuring contest” between USA and Russia. Showing its power relationship towards these two great powers.

        I just wish it wasn’t all so depressing.
