    “Recently” my website underwent a massive reformat after receiving critical feedback. The intention behind the changes I made was to create a format that was easier to access as well as build on. 
    <br><br>
    Let me start with naming conventions because…well… boring as it is, they are import. Firstly, to allow for consistency throughout the entire website which means that it is easier for myself to understand what I am. Secondly it allows for greater ease in finding aspects or sections of the website. Finally, if(when) something breaks having a consistent naming convention speeds up the debugging process. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The naming convention changes I have made are:
    <br>
    <li>All <b>html file names</b> are lowercase and if they have multiple words, they are separated using a “-”</li>
    <li><b>Button classes</b> are all lowercase and if they have multiple words, they are separated using a “_”</li>
    <li>In my <b>archive</b> blogs are named using the structure of “Blog: Date of Publication: Blog name”. The blogs themselves are titles as “Development Blog: Date of Publication”</li>
    <li><b>Variables</b> in JS are written in Camel Case and dictate what they are linked to or their function. For example, the variable for the button that holds the reference to the home page is called “backToHomeButton”</li>
