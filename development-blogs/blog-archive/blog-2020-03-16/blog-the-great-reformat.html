    <p>
    “Recently” my website underwent a massive reformat after receiving critical feedback. The intention behind the changes I made was to create a format that was easier to access as well as build on.
    </p> 
    <br><br>
    <p>
    <h3>Naming convention</h3>
    Let me start with naming conventions because…well… boring as it is, they are import. Firstly, to allow for consistency throughout the entire website which means that it is easier for myself to understand what I am. Secondly it allows for greater ease in finding aspects or sections of the website. Finally, if(when) something breaks having a consistent naming convention speeds up the debugging process. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The naming convention changes I have made are:
    <br>
    <li>All <b>html file names</b> are lowercase and if they have multiple words, they are separated using a “-”</li>
    <li><b>Button classes</b> are all lowercase and if they have multiple words, they are separated using a “_”</li>
    <li>In my <b>archive</b> blogs are named using the structure of “Blog: Date of Publication: Blog name”. The blogs themselves are titles as “Development Blog: Date of Publication”</li>
    <li><b>Variables</b> in JS are written in Camel Case and dictate what they are linked to or their function. For example, the variable for the button that holds the reference to the home page is called “backToHomeButton”</li>
    <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Development Blogs</h3>
    I have not changed the format of the development blogs themselves, but I have changed the way in which these blogs are presented to the viewer. My initial set up was having each blog on one web page. While this did provide me one simple location to put all my development blogs, it was not user friendly. As a reader would need to scroll through the entire page to find either a single blog or get to the latest blog. 
    <br><br>
    Therefore, I have adopted an archival method of storage. I have done this by directing the viewer to an archival page which contains buttons that link to each blog. Each button has the date the blog was published and the title of the blog itself. This gives the viewer direct access to each blog in a compact and concise manner.
