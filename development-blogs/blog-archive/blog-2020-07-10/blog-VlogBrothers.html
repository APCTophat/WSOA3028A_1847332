            Just because you love something ironically does not mean you do not love it. I am glad I have found people that love what I love and use that love to make something great. Enjoy.

            Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me <br>
            I ain't  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeeCQD6kR1I" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">the sharpest tool in the shed</a><br>
            he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHjqkl471HY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">looking kind of dumb</a> with her finger and her thumb<br>
            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead<br>

            Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUSV5AdblvM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#5CEAD0">the years start coming and they don't stop coming</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa22IlL-be8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">Fed to the rules</a> and I hit the ground running<br>
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TexV9aTF-Ho" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">So much to do</a>, so much to see<br>
            So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?<br>
            You'll never know if you don't go<br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1WAOvoQuS0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">You'll never shine if you don't glow</a><br>

            It's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdGAUA9WMh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">a cool place</a>, and they say it gets colder<br>
            You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older<br>

            The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
            The water's getting warm so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2ph_FeB7d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">you might as well swim</a><br>

            That's the way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrpk_AICzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">I like it</a> and I'll never get bored<br>

            Somebody once asked<br>
            Could I spare some change for gas?<br>

            I said, "Yep,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWrLfHxa53E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">what a concept</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEjo8JVqAdY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">I could use a little fuel myself</a><br>
            And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6txQ5yn5S8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"style="color:#5CEAD0">we could all use a little change</a>"<br>
