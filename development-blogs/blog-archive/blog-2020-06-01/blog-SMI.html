    <p>I read this article in preparation of writing this blog post: Freberg, K., et al. Who are the social media influencers? A study of public perceptions of personality. <i>Public Relations Review</i> (2010),  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251582746_Who_are_the_social_media_influencers_A_study_of_public_perceptions_of_personality" target="blank" rel="noopener">doi: 10.106/j.pubrev.2010.11.001</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The article identifies a Social Media Influencer (SMI) as an “independent third-party endorser who shape audience attitudes…” and states that SMIs can be employed as a promotional asset to improve a business’s rapport with their target audience. If they identify and track influencers that have a relevant connection to their brand. Basically, a shoe company that specialises in sport shoes would not approach a SMI who’s audience is built on their make up tutorial. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That is the crux why I believe that SMI are approach by companies for promotion. The companies will have access to a hyper specialised audience to advertise. If these companies have determined that this specific audience is part of their target audience, they could ensure a greater return in their investment.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The researchers conducted a research into four SMIs to determine the perceived attributes that are common between them. They found that the most common characteristics are: Verbal, Smart, Ambitious, Productive, and Poised. With the least common characteristics being: Self-pitying, indecisive, easily frustrated, self-defeating, and lacking meaning in life.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The researchers find that these characteristics of SMIs are like those of CEOs. With differences being that CEOs are perceived to be critical, sceptical, and difficult to impress while SMIs are perceived to be sort out for advice, reassuring and more likely to provide advice.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is the purpose of this research? This paper focused on SMIs in relation to company and capital. Possible to server as an education tool to readers that may be looking into employing SMIs to promote their business. I find it interesting that this paper had such a focus on the economic benefits of a SMI. It is possible that as a social media user views influencer as the personality that they like while companies outside these bubbles view a SMI as another source of potential capital. However, I don’t see this as a bad thing, if an influencer can pay for their food by me seeing a product I would not have seen and may be interested in. Then I see this system as a good thing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an important caveat to this system. The YouTuber, blogger, author and entrepreneur <i> Hank Green</i> covers an important message about having an audience in this video:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acDZYs4P-tY" target="blank" rel="noopener">Get Paid</a>. In this video he talks about buying and selling an audience and the danger of doing it. It is a short video that is interesting in the context of this paper. 
    </p>

    <h2>What does this mean for Dennis Scott </h2>
    <p>
        This article has provided a new perspective on the SMI as more than just a person but also as a potential asset. Exploring their influence over their audience’s perception of certain products or events. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, Denis Scott does not have an audience, he is mimicking what he sees. This paper did allow me to identify aspects that makes a believable Social media influencer. In the future I will make Dennis Scott come across as more “Verbal, Smart, Ambitious, Productive, and Poised”. 
    </p>
    <p>
        By giving him these characteristics would help him come across as a SMI, although he will have to sell himself better since he is still ‘building’ his audience and is not at the selling his audience phase of his career.
