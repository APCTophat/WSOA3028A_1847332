        Before I begin my discussion about <cite>“Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information”</cite> by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Matthew A. Zook <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/geo2.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.1002/geo2.8</a>, I need to ask a critical question. What is up with all the academic mumbo jumbo? 
        <br><br>
        To explain: Like all academic readings that I am presented with, I first begin by trying to find a more palatable form of the work. This is usually a YouTube video or summarised format of the piece. Why do this? I feel I do not absorb information well from text. My brain decides to wander off while my eyes continue, and I find myself several paragraphs through not having any idea what I just read and need to backtrack. I do not fault academic papers for my lack of skill in this regard. What I do fault it for, are the mental gymnastics added on top of it. 
        <br><br>
        For example, “Immutable” is a really cool word that is aptly used in the article to portray meaning. However, it took me out of the reading. I looked at it, blank stare, opened a new tab to google this word, went ‘huh’, left my desk and refilled my drink and then came back. This speedbump in my already poor reading pattern just compounded the time investment into the piece I had. This is the sort of problem I have when reading academic papers. I already have to put extra effort into understanding these higher-level concepts. The last thing I need is the language also requiring extra effort. 
        <br><br>
        TLDR: I found and watched Mark Graham’s TEDx talk about Information geographies from 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33kIWwQZ5I0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet and information geographies | Mark Graham | TEDxBradford</a>. Allowing me to begin reading the article with some prior knowledge of what the article will be about. Providing a certain level of understanding going into the article and hopefully minimising confusion about the concept.
        <br><br>
        This is not to say I took the TEDx talk as a substitution for the article as the article was had at least three extra years of research behind it. I was just using the talk as an introduction to Information Geography so that the article would not feel so alien to me.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
        The article begins by defining definition that knowledge is something that is in constant motion but the knowledge itself changes little if at all. How knowledge is moving between individuals but what is moving generally does not change from person to person. Since the artifacts transferring information are generally not affected by the transition.
        <br><br>
        It then moves to describing of the transfer of information being linked to geography. That the geography a piece of information needs to travel builds an informational geography that needs to be traversed in a specific way to be accessed.
        <br><br>
        That there is an interconnected relationship between the physical space and abstract information about that space. As the article explains that a physical space, let us say the Eiffel Tower, is not only represented by direct information about it documented and stored but also creates abstract information surrounding it. This abstract information could be personal stories, nationalism, or symbolism for other abstract concepts. This abstract information could not exist if the physical space did not exist in the same way that if there was no information about the physical space it would not exist.
        <br><br>
        To go further into that last point. I have a pencil sharpener bust of Abraham Lincoln that I got from a dollar store several years ago. You did not know about its existence until you read that information about it but to me who occupies the same space as it (my desk) it would exist regardless if I said anything or not. Its existence created a piece of information that confirms its existence for those who could not know about its existence. On a much larger scale this creates a informational “map” of everything we as humans and if something cannot be found on this map then it doesn’t or will soon cease to exist.

        <h3>Pre/Post-Digital geographies</h3>
        
        The paper begins to explain the pre-digital information geography and provides and explanation for why it looks the way it did. It begins by talking about the greatest informational transferring medium for a majority of human civilisation, Books. Looking into the fact that a book was the most efficient way to store and transfer information between individuals. However even this great technology came with its draw backs, these being Accessibility and Control. 
        <br><br>
        Books are finite and if the last copy holding some knowledge was lost, that knowledge would too cease to exist. Also, if the information on the book could not be read or understood by any person reading it then no information is transferred.
        Finally, what ever person, institution or governing body was responsible for what is written in these books held immense power. These bodies gained this power through prior privileges that allowed for more access to information over others. This can be tracked geographically to schools, university, countries, or broader ideals. As the paper states that a majority of new knowledge would have been published in the “Global North”, leaving it with a much greater power over the “Global South”.  
        <br><br><br>
        
        The paper argues that the Internet was seen at this great equalizer. That with the creation of the global internet we could see not only every person have the same opportunity to gain access to information but be part of the information creation as well. While I agree that this is a possibility, I do think that to get information off the internet a person would need a skillset just like a book would. The advantage (and disadvantage) I see with internet transferred information is the ability to add to the wellspring of information. With ‘power’ being given to everyone it is left to the individual to decide what to do with that power.
        <br><br>
        The article then investigated weather this digital information had changed the geographies of information. To do this the authors collected global wide information about the internet usage. They split this up into three categories: 
        <br><br>
            <li>Geographies of access and enablement</li>
            <li>Geographies of participation</li>
            <li>Geographies of representation</li>
        <br>
        These categories were used to segment the data gathered to answer key questions (or provide more questions). With the data gathered being from a national level. According to the paper this was done as some data points were only represented through national figure and for simplicity as to investigate the innerworkings of each country as well would be too much data.
