        Before I begin my discussion about <cite>“Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information”</cite> by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Matthew A. Zook <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/geo2.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.1002/geo2.8</a>, I need to ask a critical question. What is up with all the academic mumbo jumbo? 
        <br><br>
        To explain: Like all academic readings that I am presented with, I first begin by trying to find a more palatable form of the work. This is usually a YouTube video or summarised format of the piece. Why do this? I feel I do not absorb information well from text. My brain decides to wander off while my eyes continue, and I find myself several paragraphs through not having any idea what I just read and need to backtrack. I do not fault academic papers for my lack of skill in this regard. What I do fault it for, are the mental gymnastics added on top of it. 
        <br><br>
        For example, “Immutable” is a really cool word that is aptly used in the article to portray meaning. However, it took me out of the reading. I looked at it, blank stare, opened a new tab to google this word, went ‘huh’, left my desk and refilled my drink and then came back. This speedbump in my already poor reading pattern just compounded the time investment into the piece I had. This is the sort of problem I have when reading academic papers. I already have to put extra effort into understanding these higher-level concepts. The last thing I need is the language also requiring extra effort. 
        <br><br>
        TLDR: I found and watched Mark Graham’s TEDx talk about Information geographies from 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33kIWwQZ5I0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet and information geographies | Mark Graham | TEDxBradford</a>. Allowing me to begin reading the article with some prior knowledge of what the article will be about. Providing a certain level of understanding going into the article and hopefully minimising confusion about the concept.
        <br><br>
        This is not to say I took the TEDx talk as a substitution for the article as the article was had at least three extra years of research behind it. I was just using the talk as an introduction to Information Geography so that the article would not feel so alien to me.
