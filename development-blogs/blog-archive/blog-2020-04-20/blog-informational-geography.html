        Before I begin my discussion about <cite>“Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information”</cite> by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Matthew A. Zook <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/geo2.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.1002/geo2.8</a>, I need to ask a critical question. What is up with all the academic mumbo jumbo? 
        <br><br>
        To explain: Like all academic readings that I am presented with, I first begin by trying to find a more palatable form of the work. This is usually a YouTube video or summarised format of the piece. Why do this? I feel I do not absorb information well from text. My brain decides to wander off while my eyes continue, and I find myself several paragraphs through not having any idea what I just read and need to backtrack. I do not fault academic papers for my lack of skill in this regard. What I do fault it for, are the mental gymnastics added on top of it. 
        <br><br>
        For example, “Immutable” is a really cool word that is aptly used in the article to portray meaning. However, it took me out of the reading. I looked at it, blank stare, opened a new tab to google this word, went ‘huh’, left my desk and refilled my drink and then came back. This speedbump in my already poor reading pattern just compounded the time investment into the piece I had. This is the sort of problem I have when reading academic papers. I already have to put extra effort into understanding these higher-level concepts. The last thing I need is the language also requiring extra effort. 
        <br><br>
        TLDR: I found and watched Mark Graham’s TEDx talk about Information geographies from 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33kIWwQZ5I0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet and information geographies | Mark Graham | TEDxBradford</a>. Allowing me to begin reading the article with some prior knowledge of what the article will be about. Providing a certain level of understanding going into the article and hopefully minimising confusion about the concept.
        <br><br>
        This is not to say I took the TEDx talk as a substitution for the article as the article was had at least three extra years of research behind it. I was just using the talk as an introduction to Information Geography so that the article would not feel so alien to me.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
        The article begins by defining definition that knowledge is something that is in constant motion but the knowledge itself changes little if at all. How knowledge is moving between individuals but what is moving generally does not change from person to person. Since the artifacts transferring information are generally not affected by the transition.
        <br><br>
        It then moves to describing of the transfer of information being linked to geography. That the geography a piece of information needs to travel builds an informational geography that needs to be traversed in a specific way to be accessed.
        <br><br>
        That there is an interconnected relationship between the physical space and abstract information about that space. As the article explains that a physical space, let us say the Eiffel Tower, is not only represented by direct information about it documented and stored but also creates abstract information surrounding it. This abstract information could be personal stories, nationalism, or symbolism for other abstract concepts. This abstract information could not exist if the physical space did not exist in the same way that if there was no information about the physical space it would not exist.
        <br><br>
        To go further into that last point. I have a pencil sharpener bust of Abraham Lincoln that I got from a dollar store several years ago. You did not know about its existence until you read that information about it but to me who occupies the same space as it (my desk) it would exist regardless if I said anything or not. Its existence created a piece of information that confirms its existence for those who could not know about its existence. On a much larger scale this creates a informational “map” of everything we as humans and if something cannot be found on this map then it doesn’t or will soon cease to exist.
