    <p>
        Before I begin my discussion about <cite>“Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information”</cite> by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Matthew A. Zook <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/geo2.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.1002/geo2.8</a>, I need to ask a critical question. What is up with all the academic mumbo jumbo? 
    </p>

    <p>
        To explain: Like all academic readings that I am presented with, I first begin by trying to find a more palatable form of the work. This is usually a YouTube video or summarised format of the piece. Why do this? I feel I do not absorb information well from text. My brain decides to wander off while my eyes continue, and I find myself several paragraphs through not having any idea what I just read and need to backtrack. I do not fault academic papers for my lack of skill in this regard. What I do fault it for, are the mental gymnastics added on top of it. 
    </p>
    <P>
        For example, “Immutable” is a really cool word that is aptly used in the article to portray meaning. However, it took me out of the reading. I looked at it, blank stare, opened a new tab to google this word, went ‘huh’, left my desk and refilled my drink and then came back. This speedbump in my already poor reading pattern just compounded the time investment into the piece I had. This is the sort of problem I have when reading academic papers. I already have to put extra effort into understanding these higher-level concepts. The last thing I need is the language also requiring extra effort. 
    </P>
    <p>
        TLDR: I found and watched Mark Graham’s TEDx talk about Information geographies from 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33kIWwQZ5I0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet and information geographies | Mark Graham | TEDxBradford</a>. Allowing me to begin reading the article with some prior knowledge of what the article will be about. Providing a certain level of understanding going into the article and hopefully minimising confusion about the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not to say I took the TEDx talk as a substitution for the article as the article was had at least three extra years of research behind it. I was just using the talk as an introduction to Information Geography so that the article would not feel so alien to me.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The article begins by defining definition that knowledge is something that is in constant motion but the knowledge itself changes little if at all. How knowledge is moving between individuals but what is moving generally does not change from person to person. Since the artifacts transferring information are generally not affected by the transition.
    </p>

    <p>
        It then moves to describing of the transfer of information being linked to geography. That the geography a piece of information needs to travel builds an informational geography that needs to be traversed in a specific way to be accessed.
    </p>
    <P>
        That there is an interconnected relationship between the physical space and abstract information about that space. As the article explains that a physical space, let us say the Eiffel Tower, is not only represented by direct information about it documented and stored but also creates abstract information surrounding it. This abstract information could be personal stories, nationalism, or symbolism for other abstract concepts. This abstract information could not exist if the physical space did not exist in the same way that if there was no information about the physical space it would not exist.
    </P>
    <p>
        To go further into that last point. I have a pencil sharpener bust of Abraham Lincoln that I got from a dollar store several years ago. You did not know about its existence until you read that information about it but to me who occupies the same space as it (my desk) it would exist regardless if I said anything or not. Its existence created a piece of information that confirms its existence for those who could not know about its existence. On a much larger scale this creates a informational “map” of everything we as humans and if something cannot be found on this map then it doesn’t or will soon cease to exist.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre/Post-Digital geographies</h3>
    <p>
        The paper begins to explain the pre-digital information geography and provides and explanation for why it looks the way it did. It begins by talking about the greatest informational transferring medium for a majority of human civilisation, Books. Looking into the fact that a book was the most efficient way to store and transfer information between individuals. However even this great technology came with its draw backs, these being Accessibility and Control. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Books are finite and if the last copy holding some knowledge was lost, that knowledge would too cease to exist. Also, if the information on the book could not be read or understood by any person reading it then no information is transferred.
        Finally, what ever person, institution or governing body was responsible for what is written in these books held immense power. These bodies gained this power through prior privileges that allowed for more access to information over others. This can be tracked geographically to schools, university, countries, or broader ideals. As the paper states that a majority of new knowledge would have been published in the “Global North”, leaving it with a much greater power over the “Global South”.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The paper argues that the Internet was seen at this great equalizer. That with the creation of the global internet we could see not only every person have the same opportunity to gain access to information but be part of the information creation as well. While I agree that this is a possibility, I do think that to get information off the internet a person would need a skillset just like a book would. The advantage (and disadvantage) I see with internet transferred information is the ability to add to the wellspring of information. With ‘power’ being given to everyone it is left to the individual to decide what to do with that power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The article then investigated weather this digital information had changed the geographies of information. To do this the authors collected global wide information about the internet usage. They split this up into three categories: 
        <li>Geographies of access and enablement</li>
        <li>Geographies of participation</li>
        <li>Geographies of representation</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        These categories were used to segment the data gathered to answer key questions (or provide more questions). With the data gathered being from a national level. According to the paper this was done as some data points were only represented through national figure and for simplicity as to investigate the innerworkings of each country as well would be too much data. 
    </p>

    <h3>Geographies of access and enablement</h3>
    <p>
        The paper presents a word map which depicts the size of a country based on hexagons that represent 1/3 of a million people who use the internet in some capacity. Then each country is shaded depending on the countries “Internet Penetration”. This being the internet usage per person in a country, the darker the shading then the higher the percentage of a population use the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        This map shows some interesting qualities of internet distribution in the world. For example, China is the largest country on the map however it has a penetration rate of 20-40%. This means that in terms of internet uses, China makes up a good portion however only around 20-40% of the Chinese population use the internet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This map has shown trends such as, Asia contains a lot of internet usage but generally Europe has greater internet penetration. South America has a sizable internet population and penetration while Africa has a low internet population and penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The paper presents a possible explanation for this trend. It looked at the average cost of broadband internet as a percentage of the average income of a country. It found that a majority Europe and North America had a low-cost percentage of the yearly average income while countries in Asia had a higher cost percentage, with Africa experiencing an excessively higher cost percentage on average. This statistic can help the trends discovered in the first map. With Europe experiencing a high penetration rate due to its low relative cost and Africa experiencing a low penetration rate due to its high relative cost.        
    </p>

    <h3>Geographies of participation</h3>
    <p>
        To look at participation on the internet, this paper took information from three different areas on the internet. These being “Domain Names”, “Github” and “Wikipedia.” Each are similar but are different in how they add content onto the internet.
    </p>
    <p>

        <h4>Domain Names</h4>
        A domain name is an identifier string that is attached to a website that indicates where the website belongs to. Each country has a domain name with most of that name being used inside that country. The paper looked at these specific domain names as they can accurately indicate how much internet content a country produces. The paper found two major things when investigating these domain names. Firstly, just because a country may have a large internet population, it does not mean it has a large amount of domain registrations, eg: China and India. Secondly a majority of internet production takes place from North America and Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Github</h4>
        The paper found that North America and Europe each consists of 1/3 of all Github users. Asia is the next highest region of git users. This disproportion also extends to the amount of informational contribution each region commits. With certain large areas contributing a higher percentage of content than the percentage they make up.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Wikipedia</h4>
        The paper analysed Wikipedia edits from around the world. To see which countries are making the most edits. Wikipedia was chosen for its vast reach within the internet as it is the largest encyclopaedia site on the internet. So whoever is controlling this information has vast power. The paper found that over three month on average over a million edits comes from the USA, UK and Germany while the entire continent of Africa has less edits than Hong Kong. The paper then investigates edits to articles about content from a country made by people from that country. Basically, they investigated how much information is generated by people about their own country. Once again it found that a majority of information created about African countries is not created by African citizens as it saw on average far lower edits.
    </p>

    <h3>Geographies of representation</h3>  
    <p>
        To investigate geographies of representation the paper looked at Google Search, OpenStreetMap and the Semantic Web. They chose these systems for their openness and popularity. This would allow them access to a vast data base to retrieve information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The paper took the number of mentions of each country in googles database, in a multitude of languages, to form a table that represents their findings. The table works on the rule that the larger the amount of mentions the larger the rectangle and the larger the amount of mentions per user the darker the hue. The paper extrapolates from this that there is a strong correlation between the mention of a country and its internet users with the country’s total population. It states that these results are reflecting the broader uneven information inequalities of the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the research into OpenStreetMap, the researchers took the number of informational nodes per square kilometre for each country. They found the global north contained a majority of the total number of informational nodes with the global south lacking far behind. This means that the global north has far greater documentation about it making it easier to obtain information about.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sematic web is an interconnected system that streamlines data into clusters of relative information. As the paper puts it when a person looks up ‘The Capital of France’ this interconnected system retrieves data relevant to France and is provided data that the answer is “Paris” so the web responds to the user the answer of “Paris.” This method created patterns of concentration which are clearly and consistently seen in the global north but are not seen in the global south. There is unevenness in the information created, whether it be that information surrounding a country is created by people who mostly do not live in that country or by an intense event that cause a lot to be documented about a specific place more than others. This leaves a lot of areas to be represented far less than others.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   
    <p>
        As the amount of access to internet increases it is important to see what and where is represented by who. Currently the geography of information is skewed by who has access to the information and who is creating that information. Currently information about the world is skewed based off of an informational geography which has been created over the internet’s existence. This uneven geography has manifested into:
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>A clear favouritism of information about the global north over the global south.</li>
        <li>Greater access to information as well as the ability to change this information in North America and Europe</li>
        <li>Greater information about places that have greater opportunity to add information about itself while more remote locations need outside individuals to provide information about it.</li>
        <li>This can lead to certain geographies of the world to no longer ‘exist’ while elevating already popular places.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        This paper was an interesting dive into a topic that I believe people have may not even considered to be a thing, let alone be something that has a global influence. Although this topic does feel like something I understood subconsciously even before reading this article. Using the internet for my whole life (yes I am that young) it is evident that what I was exposed to was the content mainly made by people who had the most access to create information. Which as this paper indicates is the Northern America and Western Europe, which when looking backs makes a lot of sense. Even from a superficial level of actual consumable content such a YouTube, the people I was watcher were American’s or Europeans, predominantly English speakers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This paper is a fascinating read (a little data heavy but in a good way) and I would recommend it as a read. If for nothing else than to see how your personal understanding of the internet as an entity has a completely different look that you would not expect.
