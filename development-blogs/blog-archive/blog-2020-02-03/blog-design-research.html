        Whilst looking at websites to get ideas for how I could design my website,
        I came across the website called <a href="https://sointeractive.co.za/">SoInteractive</a>.
        What struck me the most about this website was its colour and shape identity.
        I looked at  <a href = "https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-grammar-shapes/">"The Meaning of Shapes: Developing visual Grammar"</a> gain
        a better understanding of shape theory. I decided that I wanted a triangular theme 
        to run through my webpage. To enforce that my character is stable and reliable.
        This shape theme will be incorporated in buttons, tabs or image outlines.
