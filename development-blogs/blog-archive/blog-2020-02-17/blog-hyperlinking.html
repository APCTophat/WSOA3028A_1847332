        To be honest I am not to sure, I have an understanding on what hyperlink or hypertext is, however my understanding could still be incorrect. If I am wrong, please let me know. So, from my understanding after reading N. Wardrip-Fruin,<cite>"What Hypertext is," </cite> Brown University, California, Santa Cruz, 2004. a hyperlink is an inbuilt connection to another document of relating importance. Where what these connections link to and what is connected is tailored by the author or the viewer. The purpose being to create an interactive web of knowledge that makes the navigation of and access to information easier.
