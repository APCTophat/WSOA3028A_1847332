        This blog is an explanation for the purpose of this whole website. Why it exists, who “Dennis Scott” is and what is happening on the website. <br><br>
    Firstly why? This website is a varsity assignment that <i> Should </i> be updated regularly. This website serves as my first exploration into web design and is probably not great but hey I need to learn somehow. I will be focus on making the website functional before polished. I want the website to be a usable/serviceable website before being a pretty website. <br><br>
    So, who is “Dennis Scott”? Well he doesn’t exist; he was made up by me the focus of the website. This assignment required me to make a fictional personal profile page. My understanding as to why was to grant a clear and simple subject matter. Therefore, I would focus more on the actual building of the website and not get bogged down on the website itself. <br><br>
    Finally, the website is designed to have two major sides to it. The first is what I will call the “Dennis Scott” side. This side is content on the website that relates to Dennis, this can be an about sections, posts ‘made’ by him or other bits and bobs to sell the idea that this page is a profile page for Dennis the social media influencer. The second side is the development side. This side of the website are posts by me, discussing the development of the website. This can be anything from the theory, technical and character development side of design the website.
