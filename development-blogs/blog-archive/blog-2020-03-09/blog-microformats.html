        My understanding of microformats goes as follows:	

        <li>They are added text that is not seen by the standard website viewer. They are mainly viewed by clever search engines or by invigilators who are judging the use of microformats in your website.</li>
        <li>Microformats are used to give <a href="../blog-2020-03-02/blog-metadata.html">web robots</a> information such as, what is being displayed, who is the author or when this text was published.</li>
        <li>This information can be used to help the text to be located in the vast wasteland of the internet.</li>
