        My understanding of microformats goes as follows:	

        <li>They are added text that is not seen by the standard website viewer. They are mainly viewed by clever search engines or by invigilators who are judging the use of microformats in your website.</li>
        <li>Microformats are used to give <a href="../blog-2020-03-02/blog-metadata.html">web robots</a> information such as, what is being displayed, who is the author or when this text was published.</li>
        <li>This information can be used to help the text to be located in the vast wasteland of the internet.</li>
    </p>

    <p>
        Even this blog post contains microformats. For example, this blog is contained in an article that is classified as an “h-entry.” So, what does this mean? Well the “h-” dictates that I am creating a new class object and that this is the root of the current class object. The “h-” class comes with some class names which indicate the type of data expected to be displayed. I used the “entry” name to indicate that the information I am presenting is episodic or a date stamped piece of data. This is perfect for development blog posts. Other “h-” class names include: “card” to indicate a person or organization and “feed” to indicate a stream of posts.
    </p>
    <P>
        These microformats can also denote certain properties of objects on the website. These properties are dictated by a “p-”, “u-”, “dt-” or “e-”. Each with their own meanings and uses, “p-” is used for plain properties, “u-” is used for URL properties, “dr-” is used for datetime properties and “e-” is used for element tree properties.
    </P>
    <p>
        So, the idea is to use a combination of these classes and properties to provide an accurate depiction of the information being presented. So, for example in this blog, I have dictated that it has a “h-entry” class, its title is declared as a “p-name” , I have declared a “p-author” to indicate who is the author and finally I have added a “time class” to indicate when the blog was published. All these microformats should allow a bot to figure out that this is a “blog entry” with the title of “Microformats”, written by “Alex Carvalho” on the 9th of March.
