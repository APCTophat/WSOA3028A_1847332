        I wanted to design my web page as the front page of an influencer. Visual imagery
        is the primary focus for most posts considering that my character is intended to be social media sites that I have visited. Each post 
        consisting of a title followed by an image with a description attached to it.
    
        However, since my character does not have access to a camera and therefore relies
        on stock images, the Image will be an accessory to the post as a form of
        Visual/iconic/metaphoric representation of what is being posted. My intention
        is to shift the 'viewers' perspective from 'This happened' to 'Something like this happened'
        as the visual 'proof' is just a representation of the 'truth.'
