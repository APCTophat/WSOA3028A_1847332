                <h2>Design Reasearch and Shape Theory</h2>
                <pre> 
                    Whilst looking at websites to get ideas for how I could design my website,
                    I came across the website called <a href="https://sointeractive.co.za/">SoInteractive</a>.
                    What struck me the most about this website was its colour and shape identity.
                    I looked at  <a href = "https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-grammar-shapes/">"The Meaning of Shapes: Developing visual Grammar"</a> gain
                    a better understanding of shape theory. I decided that I wanted a triangular theme 
                    to run through my webpage. To enforce that my character is stable and reliable.
                    This shape theme will be encorparated in buttons, tabs or image outlines.

                <h2>Character Design and How it Changes My Website</h2>
                <pre>
                    Whocial media influencer.
                    I wanted to design my web page as the front page of an influencer. Visual Imagry
                    is the primary focus for most sen considering that my character is intended to be social media sites that I have visited. Each post 
                    consisting of a title followed by an image with a description attached to it.
                
                    However, since my character does not have access to a camera and therefore relies
                    on stock images, the Image will beign an accessory to the post as a form of
                    Visual/iconic/metaphoric representation of what is being posted. My intention
                    is to shift the 'viewers' perspective from 'This happened' to 'Something like this happend'
                    as the visual 'proof' is just a representaion of the 'truth.'

                <h2>Hyperlinking what is?</h2>
                <pre>
                    To be honest I am not to sure, I have an understanding on what hyperlink or hypertext
                    is, however my understanding could still be incorrect. If I am wrong please let me know.
                    So from my understanding after reading 
                    N. Wardrip-Fruin, <cite>"What Hypertext is,"</cite> Brown University, Califonia, Santa Cruz, 2004. 
                    a hyperlink is an inbult connection to another document of relating importance. Where what
                    these connections link to and what is actually connected is taylored by the author or the
                    viewer. The purpose being to create an interactie web of knowledge that makes the navigation 
                    of and access to information easier.

                <h2>The medium is the message and now everything is on its head</h2>
                <pre>
                    I have had a day to stew on 
                    M. McLuhan, <cite>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</cite>, New York: MIT Press, 1964, pp. 203-209
                    specifically, "The Medium is the message" and all I can say is that my head hurts. I understand what McLuhan 
                    was getting at, I think. From my understanding of the article is that the important question
                    to ask is not "What is being made" but rather "The space in which it is being made in."
                    
                    So, it is not the context of the art piece but rather the entire medium that facilitates the art piece that 
                    conveys the artworks message. This medium is not only the physical medium but also the medium of the
                    cultural, economical, technological and sociological space the piece was created in. And that this artwork
                    conveys its message through or is a reflection of those other mediums. 

                    Which makes sense to me, sort of, I understand the principal that society movies at the rate of its fastest 
                    technology and this rate of progression trickles down into every facit of a society. However, to say that
                    the context of the 'thing', facilitated by the medium, is not the main message being portrayed just baffels me.
                   
                    Looking at the Internet as the current fastest technology and the medium it creates, I understand the importance 
                    of understanding the culture shifting potential this medium has achieved, is achieveing and is yet to achieve.
                    How what work is done in this medium is self reflective on the medium itself. That to understand what message 
                    is being portrayed by the medium is to understand the medium and by extension understand the self which has extended
                    itself by this medium.

                    This reading is really facinating and interesting but man I did not need a whole reshuffle of my understanding 
                    of life right now. 
                    
                    Also, I do not believe McLuhan solved the question of the Chicken and the egg, as I belive his
                    statement can go both ways as well. What if the egg is just the Chicken's idea for getting more Chickens HUH!
