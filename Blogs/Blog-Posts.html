                <h2><font face="Arial">Design Reasearch and Shape Theory</font></h2>
                <pre><font face="Arial">
                    Whilst looking at websites to get ideas for how I could design my website,
                    I came across the website called <a href="https://sointeractive.co.za/">SoInteractive</a>.
                    What struck me the most about this website was its colour and shape identity.
                    I looked at  <a href = "https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-grammar-shapes/">"The Meaning of Shapes: Developing visual Grammar"</a> gain
                    a better understanding of shape theory. I decided that I wanted a triangular theme 
                    to run through my webpage. To enforce that my character is stable and reliable.
                    This shape theme will be encorparated in buttons, tabs or image outlines.

                <h2><font face="Arial">Character Design and How it Changes My Website</font></h2>
                <pre><font face="Arial">
                    When considering that my character is intended to be social media influencer.
                    I wanted to design my web page as the front page of an influencer. Visual Imagry
                    is the primary focus for most social media sites that I have visited. Each post 
                    consisting of a title followed by an image with a description attached to it.
                
                    However, since my character does not have access to a camera and therefore relies
                    on stock images, the Image will beign an accessory to the post as a form of
                    Visual/iconic/metaphoric representation of what is being posted. My intention
                    is to shift the 'viewers' perspective from 'This happened' to 'Something like this happend'
                    as the visual 'proof' is just a representaion of the 'truth.'
