                <h2><font face="Arial">Design Reasearch and Shape Theory</font></h2>
                <pre><font face="Arial">
                    Whilst looking at websites to get ideas for how I could design my website,
                    I came across the website called <a href="https://sointeractive.co.za/">SoInteractive</a>.
                    What struck me the most about this website was its colour and shape identity.
                    I looked at  <a href = "https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-grammar-shapes/">"The Meaning of Shapes: Developing visual Grammar"</a> gain
                    a better understanding of shape theory. I decided that I wanted a triangular theme 
                    to run through my webpage. To enforce that my character is stable and reliable.
                    This shape theme will be encorparated in buttons, tabs or image outlines.

                <h2><font face="Arial">Character Design and How it Changes My Website</font></h2>
                <pre><font face="Arial">
                    When considering that my character is intended to be social media influencer.
                    I wanted to design my web page as the front page of an influencer. Visual Imagry
                    is the primary focus for most social media sites that I have visited. Each post 
                    consisting of a title followed by an image with a description attached to it.
                
                    However, since my character does not have access to a camera and therefore relies
                    on stock images, the Image will beign an accessory to the post as a form of
                    Visual/iconic/metaphoric representation of what is being posted. My intention
                    is to shift the 'viewers' perspective from 'This happened' to 'Something like this happend'
                    as the visual 'proof' is just a representaion of the 'truth.'

                <h2><font face="Arial">Hyperlinking what is?</font></h2>
                <pre><font face="Arial".>
                    To be honest I am not to sure, I have an understanding on what hyperlink or hypertext
                    is, however my understanding could still be incorrect. If I am wrong please let me know.
                    So from my understanding after reading 
                    <cite>N. Wardrip-Fruin, "What Hypertext is," Brown University, Califonia, Santa Cruz, 2004.</cite> 
                    a hyperlink is an inbult connection to another document of relating importance. Where what
                    these connections link to and what is actually connected is taylored by the author or the
                    viewer. The purpose being to create an interactie web of knowledge that makes the navigation 
                    of and access to information easier.
