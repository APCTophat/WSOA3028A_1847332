    <h2>Making a Character</h2>
    <p>
    I was tasked to create a character that would be the focal point for this website. This means that the character needs to be somewhat interesting and malleable. This would allow for the character to change and provide content for the changing and updating website. Also, if the character is interesting enough for me then I will not get bored at making content for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like all DnD players will know, even when playing a character that is not you, it is near impossible to not project yourself onto the fictional character. With this in mind, I began to create “Dennis Scott.”
    </p>
    </article>

    <h2>Who is Dennis Scott</h2>
    <p>
        Dennis Scott was designed to be a “social media influencer” using this website as part of his personal brand promotion. By making him a social media influencer it made the website very clear of what it would need to display. Such as his posts, contact information and other social media links.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I wanted to make him a wannabe social media influencer whose personality does not really gel with the typical social media influencers. So he isn’t that ‘hip’ or ‘trendy’ and isn’t entertaining to follow. Yet he still makes posts that mimic what typical influencers post.
    </p>
    <h3>How have I tried to do this</h3>
    <p>

  
        I started with the one thing I notice a lot of influencers use, Photographs. I decided to give Dennis the gimmick that he does not have access to a camera. So he has to resort to using stock photos to accompany his posts. To drive this point home, he blatantly uses photos with clearly defined watermarks still on the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        This meant that if “Dennis” wanted to take a photo of the lunch he was having then he needed to find a stock photo of something like visually convey his meal. Obviously, there would be no photos of Dennis himself since he does not exist, so using a stock photo gets around that issue.

    <h2>How Covid-19 has affected things</h2>
    <p>Covid-19 has made some very drastic changes to the entire world. A change on the scale that would make any megalomaniac proud. So it has affected the “influencer’ sphere drastically as well. A few things I have noticed people posting about:</p>
    <p>
        <li>What people are doing to keep themselves entertained</li>
        <li>Reminiscing about past social gatherings</li>
        <li>Raising awareness for relief efforts</li>
        <li>General entertainment such as music, art or memes</li>
    </p>
    <p>
    A positive change is now Covid-19 has provided a more believable excuse to why Dennis does not have a camera as he physically cannot go out and get a new one. So the story goes he broke his phone a few weeks before lockdown and was intending to get it replaced but with lockdown happening he is out of luck.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have noticed a stark change in the mentality of social media that I at least follow. Where before the idea was “Look at what I experienced” to “We are experiencing this thing together”. Which is a fascinating change that deserves to be looked into, but at another time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dennis posts should reflect this change, but I want it to be more that he thinks he is being relatable while slightly missing the mark. Like saying he poured his cereal before his milk for the first time to try it out and thought how “crazy it is to do things backwards”.
    </p>

        <h2>Mimicking other influencers</h2>

        <p>
            To make Dennis a more believable social media influencer I looked at what other influencers are posting to sites like <i>Instagram</i>. The general themes I found were obviously talking about current events, promotion, or personal stories and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            To stay “topical” is sort of an essential aspect of being an influencer. I will be trying to write about trendy topics such as “Dennis’s experience dealing with Convis-19 and the national lockdown.” However, I will not make any posts about a ‘trending’ movement/topic such as the “Death of George Floyd” as it is a serious topic that is not to be taking lightly. Having a post about this topic form the perspective of Dennis Scott would not be doing this topic justice and could negatively impact the discourse surrounding this situation. For these reasons I will omit any posts discussing these topics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have noticed influencers that I have seen posting about:
            <li>Working out from home</li>
<li>What they are doing to not be bored</li>
<li>Updates on life situation</li>
<li>Spreading a positive message</li>
        </p>
<p>
These are going to be things that Dennis will also be posting about. Some posts maybe me finding a funny stockphoto and building a post around it or it will be me looking for something specific and using a stockphoto that fits that description.
