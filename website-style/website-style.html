         I consider a style for a website to be the shapes/colours and layout which are presented to the viewer. This is still an area I am learning about, but I know certain things that I want to do with the website.
     </p>
     <p>
        <h4>Colour</h4>
        I want to give my website a strong colour identity but not have it be gaudy. Looking at other social media sites such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter I have noted certain aspects of their colour usage: <br><br>
	    <li> They tend to stay within one colour, with some using gradients of a major colour for clarity between different elements on the site</li>
	    <li>Most of the screen is taken up by a white base with black text or vice versa for ‘night’ modes. </li> 
	    <li>Colour is generally used for buttons/ profile bars and a general highlight tool. To generally say that “this thing” is important to the viewer</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        So I want to use colour in a similar manor on my website. Firstly I need a colour and I think I will be going for these ones: 
    </p>
        <div class="Table_Background">
        <div class="Squares">
        <div class="Square-Colour-1">#5c76ea</div>
        <div class="Square-Colour-2">#5CBDEA</div>
        <div class="Square-Colour-3">#5CEAD0</div>
        </div>
        </div>  
    <p>
        I personally like blue and I wanted an soft colour that would blend in nicely into a background. So I decided to go with #5CBDEA with a monochromatic partner #5c76ea. I decided to have a monochromatic partner to provide more definition/variety on the website. I decided on these two colours using this<a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colour Wheel</a> website and using “#5CBDEA” as my base colour. <br><br>
        Note: This is still subject to change and completely depends on how the development or personal preferences change over the course of the website.
    </p>
        <p>
        A note on vision deficiencies and my choice of colours. Google Chrome has a development toll that allows a developer to emulate a vision deficiency in their rendering tool. The options provided are:
        </p>
        <li>Blurred Vision</li> 
        <li>Protanopia</li> 
        <li>Deuteranopia</li> 
        <li>Tritanopia</li> 
        <li>Achromatopsia</li> 
        <p>
            I viewed my website through each “vision deficiencies” to see how it would look. I found that the colours I have chosen contrast well between the vision deficiencies with each colour contrasting enough to identify sections and highlights on the webpage.  I did find that for Tritanopia and Achromatopsia the hyperlinking words are harder to see from the background, so I left the styling on these words to compensate for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The header is still somewhat visible, but the content is too blurry to read. I am unsure what I could do to resolve this, but I will want to fix this issue moving forward.
