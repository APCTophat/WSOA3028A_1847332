           It has been a while since I last posted. Time has just been <i>flying</i> by so fast. I have lost track of time getting busy doing nothing. I should be posting more in the up comming week. I will see you all then.
        <br><br>
        I decided that I wanted to provide some inspiration during these trying times. So here is a quote from one of my most favourite movies of all time.
        <br><br>
        <i>Get busy living or get busy dying</i> â€“ The Shawshank Redemption, 1994.
        <br><br>
        Have a good day everyone.
