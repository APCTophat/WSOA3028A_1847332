    So may local Pick n’ Pay would not accept returns on toilet paper. I have decided to use my free time and my new building material to construct the best fort known to man. It will be two stories tall, surrounded by a moat and it will have a watch tower with a 5G signal receiver on top of it.

    I just need to go to the store because none of the bathrooms in the fort have toilet paper…

    Let me know what all of you are doing with your excess toilet paper? Please remember to like and follow me to keep up to date with all I am up to. Providing all of you with some random fun is the least I can do at a time like this.
