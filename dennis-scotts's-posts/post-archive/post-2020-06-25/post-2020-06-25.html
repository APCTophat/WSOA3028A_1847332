    The guys to fix my window still have not come. I am freezing. It is at its worst with the wind, I taped an old box to frame to cover it. This has had a less than desirable affect on keeping the cold out but at least it is something.

    I am wrapped up in so many blankets I do not know where the blankets stop, and I begin. If anyone else feels this way let me know down in the comments. Also, maybe if we spam them, they will show up. If anyone wants to do me a huge favour and send a message to <i>The Totally Legitimate Window Company </i>  @TTLWC, I would be eternally grateful.
