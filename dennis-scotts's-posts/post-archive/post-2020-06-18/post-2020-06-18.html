        How have my fellow Joburgers been keeping warm in this frozen winter? I have been burning firewood in my small metal fireplace. With the price of firewood I feel like I am burning through my money faster than I am the wood.

    I thought if I made the piece into smaller chunks, I could stretch it out more. I learnt a hard lesson that wool gloves do not grip a hatchet well. After cleaning up the broken glass out of my bathroom, I packed the hatchet away for good. I think I will leave the wood chopping to the professionals.

    It also started feeling like Cape Town, why in the world did we get rain along with this frigid temperature. I thought I had a few months to sort out my broken bathroom window. There I was towels on the floor, bathroom door shut, hoping it would not get flooded. First thing tomorrow morning I am going to call someone to replace it
