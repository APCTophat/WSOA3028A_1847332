    A have not talked about my little buddy yet so I guess now is as good of a time as any. I have a hefty rottweiler who is now 4 years old and would not even hurt a fly. He weighs 30kgs and comes up to my hip but believes he is the size of a Pomeranian. So, he always just wants to lay on my lap and crush my legs.

        I know that my boy does not need to be protected from this virus, but it is funny to picture. I can just imagine his tongue flopping out of the side of the mask on his walk. Which always just brings me joy.

    I do believe that a pet can create so much joy  especially during a time like this. I would recommend any person that can support a pet and give it a loving home to do so. Also I would recommending adopting from a shelter. There are so many dogs that are looking for a good home, it is how I got my boy Bruce.
