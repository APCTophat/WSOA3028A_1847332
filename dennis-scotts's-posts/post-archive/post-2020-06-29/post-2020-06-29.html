        I need to apologise to my fans. I am sorry but I will be taking a bit of a break from social media for a while. This winter has been rough and with lockdown not seeming to be lifting any time soon I need to prioritise putting food on the table. Unfortunately, I cannot live off what I earn from doing this anymore as advertisers and sponsors are slowing down. Therefor I need to stop and to get back on my feet. Once I have stabilized my life somewhat and things have returned a sense of normalcy I will continue posting.
        </p>
        <p>
        I truly am sorry to leave you all but please know this is not permanent and that even though my voice is gone there are plenty of fantastic people you can also listen to. Please keep safe everyone and for the last time, goodbye.
        </p>
