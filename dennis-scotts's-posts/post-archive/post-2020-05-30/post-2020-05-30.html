     Welp... I broke my promise. Sorry everyone :( Life has just been hard at the momen, it has been hard for everyone. I am feeling much better this weekend but it has been hard.

    Keep safe everyone and do all you can to reduce your chance of getting or spreading this virus.

    Wash you hands and stay home if you can.
