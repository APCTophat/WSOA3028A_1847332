        I have been getting dm’s about my photos, so I will leave this post here as an explanation. About three weeks before the lockdown I was walking out of my local Meat World with my bag of biltong in my hand. I took out my phone to tell my dad I was coming over for Sunday braai. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Then this BMW nearly knocks me down while I was walking to my car. I was so startled that both my phone and the biltong were thrown into the air. I only had enough time to catch one. So that is how my phone’s camera broke along with a portion of my screen.
    </P>
    <p>
        Now with the lockdown I have been unable to get a replacement phone. Hope you all don’t mind and can bear with me for now. 
    </P>
