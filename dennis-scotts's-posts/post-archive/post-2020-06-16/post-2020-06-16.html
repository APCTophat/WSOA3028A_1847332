    What in the world happen! How did it get so cold so quickly? Yusis, I cannot feel my fingers. Suddenly having to stay in quarantine does not sound like such a bad idea. I am perfectly okay with staying inside if this is what I must face. I do not want to get icicleâ€™s forming on my quarantine beard.

    There is the decision that needs to be made. Brace the cold for a few hours getting firewood or be semi-warm for the whole day. This is truly a tough decision.
