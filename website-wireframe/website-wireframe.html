        This is the plan for how I want my website to look like. <br>
        My main intention is to create a "social media" style page.<br>
        With a post-feed, profile and navigation from a main screen.
    </p>
    <p>
    <img class="Wireframe" src="Website WireFrame.png" width="70%" height="90%"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        I ended up not going for this plan as I was having trouble with that format. The way I had figured out how to display the rest of the website from my home page was not sustainable and would of lead to further issues when I needed to change it down the line. So I scrapped that idea and started new. 
        I decided to go with a much simplier idea of having a Navigation bar on top of the screen, with all the contentent interacted with below that. The Navigation bar is in the header on each page with the rest of the body dedicated to the contentent on the page.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The header and body should adjust to screen size and with certain pages I adjust the content displayed when the screen gets small enough. Hopegully this keeps my website functional at all screen resolutions. While I know that there are some alignment, scale and functionality issues with my website, I do not have the time right now to fix them while I still need to improve my website in other avenues. I intend to fix these issues later.
